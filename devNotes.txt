METHOD 1 FOR IMPLEMENTING THE VISION PART:
- Using array to represent grid, select 2 or 3 candidate positions per boardstate.
The candidate positions are based on the shape of a 3-5 wide section of the board, 
given a per setup value depending on how easy it is to build the setup from that shape. 
These shape values should be precalculated based on the setup. For example, the procedure
to add imperial cross to the setup list would be to first calculate the best shapes leading
into imp cross. SO, NEED TO MAKE A TOOL TO CALCULATE BEST SHAPES FOR EACH SETUP.

If i generate these best shapes for each setup using a backtracking procedure, each shape could
have its own set of pieces that directly create the setup. maybe. ok! done.
